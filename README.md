# The Caribbean Coffee Company ![](./.common/logo.png?raw=true)
by Joel Mussman<br/>
original project concept by Joel Mussman and Justin Poole 

The Caribbean Coffee Company is a cafe-operations project that I have developed as the basis for doing demonstrations
and class labs for almost every software development technology that I work with, from databases through devices.
The premise is that a customer can use a web site or a device app to browse the menu of the cafe, place an order,
and pay for it.
Cashiers and managers also reach the back-end through the web portal and point-of-sale terminals.

## TC3-Project-Core

Documentation for the TC3 project: user stories, use cases, and diagrams.
In this repository are three top-level folders: Final, Source, and Starter.
The Starter folder contains resources, many of which contain errors for participants to locate and fix.
THe Final folder contains final versions of the resources that may be used to build the projects; specific instances of these may be copied into
the related project repositories.
The Source folder contains the source for what ends up in Starter and Final as PDF files.
Visual Paradigm [https://www.visual-paradigm.com/](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/) is the tool used for UML and database diagrams.
Microsoft Word is used for the user stories and use cases.

Everything in this project is distributed freely under the MIT license (see below).
If you want to use it for demonstrations or as the basis of a lab for your own course, feel free.
I consider it to be a compliment and an honor that you want to use my material, and I would much rather be
a collaborator than a competitor!
Feel free to contact me, and if you could, please give me credit when you use this.
